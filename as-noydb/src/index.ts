/**
 * **@noy-db/as-noydb** — encrypted `.noydb` bundle export.
 *
 * The sole member of the Fork · As **encrypted tier**. Wraps the core
 * `writePod()` primitive with:
 *
 *   1. The `canExportBundle` authorization gate — default
 *      on for owner/admin, off for operator/viewer/client. The
 *      asymmetric default reflects asymmetric risk: a bundle is inert
 *      without the KEK, so owner backups don't need the per-format
 *      friction of the plaintext tier.
 *   2. The usual audit-ledger entry (`type: 'as-export'`,
 *      `encrypted: true`) so regulators see every bundle egress even
 *      though contents stay encrypted.
 *   3. Ergonomic browser-download / Node-file-write / in-memory-bytes
 *      helpers that parallel the plaintext-tier siblings.
 *
 * **Zero-knowledge preserved.** Unlike `as-csv` / `as-json` / …, this
 * package never reveals a single byte of plaintext to its caller or
 * any downstream handler. The vault's DEKs re-encrypt the body before
 * it leaves the gate; the bundle header is the minimal-disclosure
 * shape defined in `docs/reference/architecture.md`.
 *
 * **No `acknowledgeRisks: true` on `write()`.** Writing a `.noydb` to
 * disk is a legitimate encrypted-tier destination — the bytes are
 * ciphertext. The applicable risk is "don't also store the
 * secret on the same disk", not "don't write the bytes". The risk
 * is therefore documented rather than gated.
